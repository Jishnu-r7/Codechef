Problem
The followers of Psycho-Helmet religion follow a peculiar calendar – a normal year contains N days. Every K-th year is a “MOB” year. For example, if K=4, then years 4,8,12,16… are “MOB” years. A “MOB” year contains M additional days i.e. it contains N+M days.

Given X, determine whether the day after (X-1) days from Day 1 of Year 1 falls in a “MOB” year.
