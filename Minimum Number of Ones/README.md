Problem
Your teacher gave you an assignment — given an integer N, construct a binary string B=b1 b2 b3...bN of length N such that:
	max(bi, bi+1) = 1
for every i from 1 to N−1.
What is the minimum number of 11's such a binary string can contain?

Note: A binary string is a string consisting of only the digits 0 and 1.
