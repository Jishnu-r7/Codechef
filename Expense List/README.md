Expense List
Problem Code: EXPENSES

Problem
Chef has made a list for his monthly expenses. The list has NN expenses with index 1 to N. The money spent on each expense depends upon the monthly income of Chef.

Chef spends 50% of his total income on the expense with index 1.
The money spent on the i^{th} expense (i>1) is equal to 50% of the amount remaining, after paying for all expenses with indices less than i.
Given that Chef earns 2^X rupees in a month, find the amount he saves after paying for all N expenses.
